General Advice
Start early. Put in enough work. If you do not do enough, you will fail.
Conversely, do not spend the whole of the Easter vacation on your project at the expense of your revision. A double module project represents only one third of your final-year assessment, translating into one fifth of your overall degree mark. You cannot afford to neglect the other two-thirds of your final-year mark.
The writeup and the project itself must use and apply Computer Science; it is not sufficient to purposelessly produce an implementation. This above all is the major weakness of past projects.
Include a high-quality literature survey.
Include results. A project without results and an evaluation of them is useless.
Important Note
If you get into difficulties with your project work, for example you feel you face insurmountable problems, or you feel your progress is inadequate, you must contact your supervisor, or the project coordinator, or the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Do not take any hasty action which you may have cause to regret later. Do not take short cuts, or attempt to disguise the problem in your program or writeup.

Some Useful Hints
Each year, the examiners find that some students have lost marks quite needlessly in the management and presentation of their projects. The following hints are intended as a summary of the ways in which this can be avoided:

Read this document several times during the year and follow its advice.
If you are using your own machine, keep backups. This is your responsibility and no allowance will be made for a lost project.
Make the most of your supervisor's help, by preparing for meetings and asking sensible questions.
Remember that the third-year project represents a substantial piece of work, so the examiners will be looking for major progress and substantial deliverables. In previous years, examiners have expressed concern about the work content of some projects.
Pay adequate attention to the Results section of your work. An implementation with no results is not worth many marks.
Remember that the project paper carries much weight.
Give full details of all your references so that the reader can find them for themselves if necessary. Remember that References are papers or books that you have explicitly cited in your reports. A Bibliography is simply a list of relevant material which may not be cross-referenced. You should supply a References section. In general, simply using the standard course text-books is not sufficient, nor is just referencing material on the web.
Use diagrams in your final paper. "A picture is worth a thousand words", and is an important medium for communication. Ensure that a key is given for boxes, lines, etc. (even professional papers often fail to do so).
Do not leave the writing up of the final paper until the Easter vacation. It is again too late to receive adequate support from your supervisor supervisor. Make a plan for submitting a draft during Epiphany term.
Pay due attention to grammar and learn to write in an academic style. A common failing in this respect is the use of the first person singular (out of place in scientific or technical writing).
Make sure that the reports have a proper academic content.
Do not bore the examiners with excessive unimportant detail - put yourself in the shoes of the reader who is not familiar at all with you or your project.
Use of Students' Computers
A student may use their own computer for part or all of the practical work involved in a project, provided that it is suitable for the purpose (as agreed with the supervisor) and that any proprietary software used is properly licensed. Note that the University's site licenses do not normally cover students' personal computers.

If a personal machine is used, the responsibility for back-ups, etc. lies entirely with the student. If, for example, a student loses programs and/or data and is unable to demonstrate deliverables, no allowance will be made. Third-year students are expected to be aware of sensible back-up/security procedures on their own equipment. Ignorance or carelessness is not acceptable as an excuse.
Supervision
The guidelines for meetings are given in the document found in this module under "Start here -> Staff and Student Responsibilities Regarding Meetings".

Those are the responsibilities regarding meetings. More generally, you may find the responsibilities for the overall project below. These guidelines are based on the report, Academic Standards in Universities, published by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals (1986):

Responsibilities of the Supervisor
to give guidance about the nature of the project and the standard expected, about the planning of the project, about literature and sources, about techniques and methods and about any problems of plagiarism;
to maintain contact via regular tutorial meetings;
to be accessible within reason at other times for giving advice to the student;
to give detailed advice on milestones;
to request written work as appropriate and return such work with constructive criticism within a reasonable time (students can expect supervisors to read one draft of each written submission of project work. Details on when to submit drafts in order to receive timely feedback will be provided)
to ensure that a student is made aware of any inadequacy of progress, or of standards of work below those expected;
to encourage the student to produce an early draft of the final paper, to comment on such a draft critically and return the comments promptly. If the student does not do so, this is the student's responsibility.
Responsibilities of the Student
to agree on a schedule of meetings with the supervisor and to attend such meetings;
to take the initiative in raising problems, however elementary they may seem;
to maintain the progress of the work in accordance with the milestones and objectives agreed with the supervisor;
to contribute to planning the project and monitoring progress against the plan;
to keep a project log for recording results, ideas, references etc. acquired as the project progresses;
to determine the contents of the reports and of oral presentations;
to submit a draft of the final paper to the supervisor two weeks before the summative deadline.
In summary, the management of the project and the course that it takes, are ultimately the responsibility of the student.

Documentation Related to Project Progress aka Student Log
Information regarding how to document project progress can be found in this module under "Start here -> Staff and Student Responsibilities Regarding Meetings".

An important point to emphasise is the following: The student log will be taken into consideration when awarding the supervisor mark at the end of the project so it counts towards your final grade.

Frequently Asked Questions about L3 project supervision

 

What can I expect from my supervisor?

Weekly supervision meetings in weeks 1 through 21. Students are asked to contact their assigned supervisor at the start of term 1 to arrange their first supervision meeting, which should take place in week 1 (and in the interests of fairness, project meetings should not take place before this). Each meeting should be 30 minutes in duration, and these are typically individual, face-to-face meetings – though group meetings (see below) can also be used for some meetings. Your supervisor’s primary role in these meetings is to give strategic guidance about project design and direction, keep track of progress towards the project plan, and advise you about the standard of work expected in order to get a good mark for the project summative components.
Feedback on the formative submission. After you submit your work for the formative assignment, your supervisor will give you written feedback on it in through Ultra. This will normally include feedback on aspects such as: general project design; project deliverables; structure of the literature survey; content of the literature survey; and to what extent the most obviously apparent avenues of the literature have been adequately explored. It’s very much in your own interest to produce a complete project plan and literature survey by the deadline, because this informs the direction of the project as a whole going forward, and can often help identify potential issues early on so they can be corrected before they result in serious delays.
Advice on marking criteria and expectations for each summative component. The project module has several components that are assessed for credit and count towards your overall project mark. The criteria and mark schemes are available on Ultra. You should discuss with your supervisor what the general expectations and requirements are for each component, and how best to ensure that you produce work that will meet these criteria in a supervision session before the assessment takes place.
Feedback on a draft of your project report. You can expect your supervisor to read and give feedback (either written or oral) on one version of each section/chapter of your report – provided you allow sufficient time for them to do so (allow at least two weeks). Producing written work early on is highly advisable, so that you will have time to take into account any suggested modifications before submitting your paper.


What are “deliverables”?

Deliverables are concrete outputs – such as an implementation of a specified algorithm or software component, or a proof or significant lemma – that are expected to be produced in order to deliver your project and make writing the report possible.
Your deliverables should be divided into “Basic”, “Intermediate”, and “Advanced”. Projects typically have around 9 deliverables (3 per category) stated in their project plan; it is recommended that you express these concisely using bullet points in the project plan.
It is not required that you ultimately produce all deliverables listed in the project plan, though you should aim to do so. The basic deliverables should be structured such that completing them alone should provide sufficient results to be able to pass the module; if additionally completed, the intermediate deliverables should correspond to a successful project that might result in a good or very good mark; completing one or more advanced deliverables should correspond to a very successful project that might result in an excellent mark – subject of course to appropriate write-up and presentation in each case.
Generally, you will start work on basic deliverables first, then move on to intermediate, and then advanced only after those have been completed. For example, in an experimental project, your basic objectives might include implementing a baseline technique, one additional technique, and evaluating these on a relevant dataset; intermediate might include implementing more complex or challenging techniques or comparing across additional datasets; advanced might include combining or adapting some of these into one or more novel techniques to address the same task.


What else should I consider when writing the project plan?

If your project requires use of any datasets, find out what these are, and obtain, store and carefully examine a copy of them as soon as possible. Datasets referenced in papers are not always easily available – you may need to contact the authors, who may or may not reply and agree to share them with you (try writing them a polite e-mail mentioning that you have read their paper and are planning to work on an undergraduate project at Durham’s Computer Science department, asking whether they are able to share their data with you so you can use it in your project work).
Sometimes the format of a dataset may not be what you might expect it to be based on the description given in a paper (e.g. where licensing agreements prevent the authors from distributing it in what might seem like the most straightforward way).
If your supervisor has suggested that they or their collaborators may have a suitable dataset, ask them to give you a copy of this so you can take a look at it before writing your project plan.
Never design any project in a way that relies on use of a dataset which you have not personally obtained, examined, and confirmed contains all of the data required. Doing so puts your project at risk of serious and easily avoidable delays, which in the worst case can necessitate a complete redesign of the whole project well after the start of term, potentially wasting many weeks of work.


What can I do to get a good mark?

Read and carefully follow the advice given under “General advice” in the Ultra module page.
Pay careful attention to the marking criteria for each assessed component in the Ultra module. Remember that staff will be marking your work according to exactly those criteria, so you should make sure that what you submit addresses the aspects that are being assessed. Note that the criteria can inform aspects of project design (e.g. how your evaluation will work), so don’t wait until you are actually writing the report to start thinking about these – familiarize yourself with the marking criteria for e.g. the project report (the highest weighted summative component) at the beginning of term 1, before you write your project plan.


Can I change supervisor?

No. A formal allocation process is in place – which you are asked to engage with well ahead of time – that determines who will supervise your project. Once this has been set, it is not possible to change supervisor. If you are not happy with the direction of your project towards the start of term 1, discuss this with your supervisor while there is still time to make adjustments (see also the next two questions). If you are not happy with the format of your supervision sessions, discuss this with your supervisor.


Can I change project?

With the agreement of your supervisor, you can refine the project specification that you have received (or your own self-proposed project specification, if your project was self-proposed). It is strongly suggested that any changes take place before the formative “Literature Review and Project Plan” assignment is due. This mechanism is intended for minor changes of project direction/focus, and in particular cannot be used to change to an entirely different project specification that was made available during the allocation process.


My project involves X but my supervisor is an expert in Y – what can I do?

Bear in mind that even if your supervisor is an expert in a technical area involved in your project, their role in the project is not as lecturer or tutor on the subject area itself, but to give you strategic guidance on project planning and direction, and advice on meeting the marking criteria for the project assessment points so that you submit the best work you can. Note also that supervision time is limited compared to the amount of self-directed work you are expected to do on your project: there would not be sufficient time for a supervisor to teach you the relevant content alongside their normal project supervision duties. All department teaching staff are qualified to supervise the allocated projects. Similarly, the examiners of your summative submissions will typically not be experts on the specific topic, and your report should be written in such a way as to be understandable to any computer scientist.


What is group supervision?

Most supervision sessions are individual meetings. In some cases, group supervision may be offered for some sessions, typically in cases where several students are working on closely related projects. Group supervision sessions should be scheduled for 1 hour or longer (depending on the number of students) and should not be used for more than half of all supervision sessions. Group supervision requires the agreement of all students involved – if as a student you would prefer to have individual meetings instead, just let your supervisor know this.


I have a scheduled supervision meeting but I haven’t made any progress – what should I do?

Attend the meeting and discuss the project and its next steps with your supervisor. It’s not your supervisor’s job to admonish you or make you feel bad about lack of progress, but to encourage you to keep the project on track and help you to produce your best work. If you have no progress to report, try to think about what aspects of the project you’re unsure of or have questions about, and discuss these with your supervisor in the session. It may also be useful to discuss your overall workload and project timeline with your supervisor in order to make adjustments if needed. Contact time with your supervisor is limited, and you should aim to make the best use of it that you can regardless of progress over the past week.


My project requires high performance computing resources – what support is available?

The department has high-performance GPU (NCC) and CPU (mira) clusters available to support projects requiring these resources. If you need GPU compute, use NCC; if you require only CPU but your processes have long runtime and/or high CPU/RAM requirements, use mira.


I don’t have a laptop that can be used for the project work – are any available?

Bear in mind that if you have a slow/old laptop that’s nevertheless usable for editing code, you can easily make use of the department’s high performance computing resources to actually run your code – in many cases doing this can also be beneficial to your project, by increasing the feasible number of experiments and/or sizes of datasets you can report on.


My project requires that I purchase X – can the department help pay for this?

Possibly, as long as the item is justified and essential to the project, and the total cost is less than £150. After discussing the requirement with your supervisor, your supervisor should submit a purchase request into LabSafe for approval using the account S0200003; when doing so, they should mention in the request that it is to support L3/L4 project work, and also mention the name of the student to whom the request applies. In case of questions about this process or if your supervisor does not have access to this account, your supervisor should contact the CS Finance Office to discuss this: cs.financeoffice@durham.ac.uk.


Please submit via Ultra (see "Assessment" tab) a single pdf document containing the following three items:

1. Project plan

A short (ideally up to 2 pages) document including the following information:

Names of you and your supervisor
Title of your project
A short project description (up to half a page)
A list of deliverables, split into three categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced
A timeline (e.g. a GANTT chart) indicating timescales for objectives and deliverables
A list of references
It should provide:

A quick glance at the broader topic and your specific subject, as well as your aims and objectives.
An indication of preliminary preparation: what do you need to prepare / understand better?
2. Literature survey

Your literature survey should give an overview of published work relevant to your project, highlighting the key findings of papers discussed and explaining how these relate to your proposed project. There is no set format, but it should not exceed 5 pages.

3. Critical comparison with ChatGPT

Having completed your own literature survey, experiment briefly with ChatGPT (or a comparable generative LLM chatbot suited to the task) to create a second, "AI Literature survey" for your chosen topic. 

Please submit:

The prompt or prompts that were given to the system which caused it to generate the output. If necessary, modify or give additional prompts so that the text generated includes citations.
The final unmodified output (it is not necessary to include a whole chat log, only the final version).
A short paragraph of your own observations on the quality and accuracy of its output - in particular, which things it appeared to get right or wrong, and whether any citations produced appear to be accurate (i.e. refer to an identifiable paper the title of which plausibly relates to the content). 

Overview
One of the objectives of the project is to allow the student to exercise the skills, knowledge, approach, and critical faculties acquired in the first two years of study. The application of these attributes must be clearly visible in the project. A common cause of criticism by examiners of project work is that the student has not incorporated work and approaches from earlier years of study in their degree programme, and that the task has become simply an implementation. However large an implementation, this type of project work is likely to receive very low marks. The writeup should be an academic writeup, not a product description nor a piece of journalism and must conform to the Final Paper Template. A critical approach must be clearly evident; use of material from earlier years must be achieved. Top priority must be given to establishing the academic context of the project, and showing its relation to other work in the field.

A good project will include:

excellent progress against objectives (i.e. hard work);
a major contribution from the student in organising and managing the project;
clear evidence of application of knowledge, skills, approach, and critical faculties from the rest of the course (this is the single most important criterion);
an excellent literature review and exposition of the academic context;
a deliverable of good quality and full presentation of results;
the display of good communication skills.
Third-year projects are not research projects, in that there is no obligation (as in a Ph.D.) to produce original work. There will, however, be scope in all projects for innovation and enterprise by the student.
Literature Survey
The aims of the literature survey are as follows:

to show that you can do a proper literature survey (an important skill);
to determine the state of the art in project areas;
to acquire a set of useful techniques/methods/algorithms to make a strong start.
The literature survey, possibly extended/modified, will be included in the Final Paper.

Guidelines for the Literature Survey
How Not To Do It
Do not simply list each book or paper you have read with a precise description of it.

How To Do It
Typically the first page is used to define your terms and to give references to where you found the definition. For example, on a project on safety critical systems, it would be essential to define very carefully `safety critical systems' and other terms such as `safety', `reliability', `error free', and so on.

The next three pages should be used to select some themes. If your project was about compiler parsers, good themes might be:

parsing algorithms,
tools,
language classification.
You then give a succinct, careful description of each of these as if you were addressing an experienced computer scientist who was not an expert in the area. As your description develops, cite references to books/papers where you found the information.

Finally use the last page to assess the themes, draw some conclusions and show how you will use it in your project.

Why Do a Literature Survey?
For reuse. There is no point in reinventing the wheel. Find out what has been done before and use it. But it is essential to cite and reference your sources.

How Many Papers/Books?
It is hard to put an exact number on this, and it will vary from project to project. A typical number might be around 15-25.

Format
A maximum of 5 pages of A4 following the recommendations above.
Project Plan
The third-year project will probably be the first major piece of individual work that you have undertaken and the proper management of it is essential for success. Thus, it is necessary to pay full attention to planning the project. It is fair to say that a first-class project does not derive only from technical flair; other important ingredients are good management and organisation.

Management of the project is the responsibility of the student; however, the student should seek, and take advantage of, the advice of their supervisor in this task. Management involves two main tasks:

preparing a plan;
monitoring progress against the plan.
A plan may be changed if circumstances require it. However, a project without any plan stands little chance of success. Students typically become very enthusiastic about their projects and strongly committed to them. This is of course very welcome but the time spent on the project should allow adequate attention to be paid to the remaining parts of the course. It should be remembered that the project contributes an important, but not the dominant share of the degree mark and a good class of degree can only be achieved by good performance in the examinations as well as in the project.

You should expect, over the course of the third year, to allocate roughly 12 hours per week to a double module project. The time you have available each week might vary, but you should bear in mind this expected workload.

In planning your work, and in discussion with your supervisor, you should be careful to identify basic, intermediate and advanced deliverables, intended to fulfill the corresponding objectives in the original project proposal. Occasionally, adverse circumstances, or the results of your initial investigations, mean that your deliverables need to be revised. This should be done only in consultation with, and with the approval of, your supervisor.

Format
A short document (ideally up to 2 pages) that gives an outline (preferably one page) of the project together with a plan (preferably one page), which includes a Gantt chart. The idea of this report is to focus your mind on the objectives and plan; commitment to a particular course of investigation at this stage makes it possible to ensure that the necessary tools, software, etc. are available.
